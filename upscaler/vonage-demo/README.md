# Vectorly Vonage Demo

A quickstart demo example showing how to integrate Vectorly's AI Upscaling SDK with Vonage Video.

### Vonage Account
First, load make sure you have an account with Vonage. You can use the [following tutorial](https://tokbox.com/developer/tutorials/web/basic-video-chat/) for getting set up with a basic working version of Vonage.


### Vectorly Account
You can also get your Vectorly account token by going to  the [Vectorly Dashboard](https://upscaler.vectorly.io/#/upscaler) and choosing "Just show my token"


### Loading the page
Once you've put in the appropriate tokens, you can load index.html into Chrome or firefox. Load the same file in two different tabs or two different browsers so see both a publisher and subscriber stream. 

This example just does upscaling on the subscriber stream.
